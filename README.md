## Bio

My name is William Ignatius Wijaya. I am a rising junior at University of California, Berkeley majoring in Industrial Engineering and Operation Research (IEOR) and minoring in Data Science. 

## Acknowledgment

I would like to thank Dr. Adam Anderson for teaching us this course and all his efforts in grading our assignment. I would also thank the Ash Tan for providing us the tools and resources related to the technical parts of the coding. Finally, I would like to also thank to my classmates who helped me into shaping my project and providing me feedbacks during the planning phase of the project.

## Project Description

My project is about comparison between two most common genres in Christian music: Christian Traditional Music (CTM) and Christian contemporary Music (CCM). In this project, I want to focus primarily how two of these genres differs given that generally both of these genres are created with the same purpose, i.e., to praise and glorify God. I want to know what makes both of these genres differs in term of their word usage, audio features, message, and emotions. To answer my questions, I will be using dataset of top 50 songs from Spotify for both CTM and CCM genres. And, to construct my dataframe, I will type the title and artist manually to my dataset, pull out the lyrics from either genius API or musixmatch API, and pull out the audio features from Spotify API, then I will proceed to clean and analyze my dataset. 

## What's inside my Repository

Inside my Repo, I will be including:

1. Storyboard: Storyboard is the place where I communicate my projects. Storyboard is like a poster, where this is the place I explain my project in-depth. Before looking into the notebook, I suggest to look into the storyboard for further explanation relating to my project. 
2. Notebook: This is my code that I use for this project. 
3. Presentation slides: This is where I summarized my projects in form of PowerPoint slides.
